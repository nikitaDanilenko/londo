# Londo

This tool allows hosting progress tracking of several users.
Every user can create projects and make these projects visible to a
collection of users.
Users can configure dashboards to view the progress of users
on a list of selected projects.

The tool's only purpose is displaying and tracking the progress,
there is no integration with common project management tools.
The main reason for this tool is to show a pretty progress
report.

## Naming

The name `londo` hints at [Londo Mollari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Londo_Mollari),
a character from the TV show [Babylon 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylon_5).
In a memorable, but very dark scene the character ecstatically states "Ah, progress!"
